Gallery
=======

This plugin for MCServer enables the server admins to declare parts of the world as galleries. Users can request an area in the gallery, the area will be automatically created, filled with predefined content and the user (and server admins) are the only players allowed to interact with the blocks in that area.

The primary objective for this plugin is to provide a means for the MCServer community to have a public server where people can build their ideas to include in the world generator
